# Project3 - CNN Image Classifier with PyTorch

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing the implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based image classifier using PyTorch.

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates the process of:
- Downloading and preprocessing the CIFAR-10 dataset
- Implementing a CNN architecture with removed Conv2d and ReLU layers
- Defining training parameters and training the model
- Evaluating the model's accuracy on the test set
- Generating predictions for sample images in the test set

## Contents
- [Notebook](Assignment3.ipynb): Jupyter Notebook containing the code for dataset loading, model architecture, training, and evaluation.
- [Sample Data](CIFAR10/): Sample CIFAR-10 dataset files used for training and testing.

## Prerequisites
- Python [version]
- Jupyter Notebook
- PyTorch
- torchvision
- matplotlib
- numpy

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook: `jupyter notebook Assignment3.ipynb`
3. Follow the instructions and code in the notebook to explore the CNN image classifier implementation.

## Usage
- The Jupyter Notebook provides step-by-step guidance on dataset loading, CNN architecture modification, model training, and evaluation.
- Run each cell in the notebook to see the implementation in action.
- Experiment with different model architectures and hyperparameters to enhance the model's performance.

## Results and Discussion
- The notebook showcases the process of modifying a CNN architecture and its impact on model performance.
